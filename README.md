# Guess-the-Combination
 Assignment: ​Write a complete, well-documented Java program that will generate a new random combination that must be guessed at each round (if you don’t correctly guess it in the last round). The random combination does not have to be unique, meaning that a random combination in round 2 or round 3 can be the same number from round 1. Design your program so that during each round it restricts the range of the next guess to be between their closest guessed numbers. For example, if a player’s first guess of 955 is lower than the combination, then their next guess will have to be between 956 to 999. Conversely, if their first guess of 969 is higher than the combination, then their next guess will have to be between 900 to 968. Display an error message if the player attempts to guess a number outside the allowed range of guesses. The end of a round will have only two outcomes – a win or a loss:
